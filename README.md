This project applies Design and Analysis of Algorithms concepts to model and enhance the planning of a visionary smart city named Vishalanagri. Designed for a thriving population of 28 million with a density of 18,000 per sq km, Vishalanagri stands as India’s capital of civic innovation. The project explores business cases, optimization challenges through Greedy, Dynamic Programming, and Divide-and-Conquer techniques, routing with Graph and Shortest Path algorithms, and sector-wise analysis spanning agriculture, industry, commercial zones, government services, and intelligent traffic management.
