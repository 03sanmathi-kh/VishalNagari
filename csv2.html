    <h1>Vishalnagari Candidate Selection Module</h1>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      In the smart city of Vishalnagari, local authorities and companies aim to promote 
      local talent while ensuring that only the most qualified candidates are selected for employment.
      Every month, companies post job openings with specific skill requirements, such as proficiency 
      in programming languages, data analysis, or technical expertise. The city has a diverse pool 
      of candidates, including residents of Vishalnagari and students from other areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective of the system is to select candidates efficiently, applying the following rules:
      Only candidates meeting all required skills for a job are considered; 
      Vishalnagari students are given preference over non-local candidates when multiple eligible candidates exist;
      and within local and non-local groups, candidates are ranked by experience, academic score, or certifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system must handle multiple job postings and a large number of candidates, 
      ensuring fair, prioritized selection and providing transparency to employers and applicants.
    </p>

    <h2>Algorithm Used</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Heap / Priority Queue-Based Selection:</strong> 
      Candidates are filtered for skill requirements, then inserted into a max-heap where priority is computed based on:
      local status, experience, academic score, and certifications. The heap allows efficient extraction 
      of top candidates for each job posting.
    </p>

    <p class="efficiency">
      Algorithm Efficiency: O(n × log n) for building and extracting candidates from the heap per job posting
    </p>

    <h2>Algorithm Flow</h2>
    <img src="selection_flow.png" alt="Algorithm Flow Diagram" class="center-img">

    <h2>Design Techniques Used</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Heap / Priority Queue:</strong> Efficient top candidate extraction.<br>
      <strong>Filtering:</strong> Ensures candidates meet all required skills.<br>
      <strong>Prioritization:</strong> Gives preference to Vishalnagari residents.<br>
      <strong>Ranking:</strong> Orders candidates based on experience, academics, and certifications.<br>
      <strong>Decomposition:</strong> Breaks the system into input processing, filtering, prioritization, and ranking modules.<br>
      <strong>Abstraction:</strong> Represents complex candidate data as simplified numerical scores for heap ordering.
    </p>

    <h2>Relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>SDG 4 – Quality Education:</strong> Encourages skilled candidates to apply their knowledge.<br>
      <strong>SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth:</strong> Supports fair employment and local talent development.<br>
      <strong>SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities:</strong> Gives preference to local students while maintaining merit-based ranking.
